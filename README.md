## **Advantages:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive design, making it easy for users to interact with the application.
2. **Local Data Persistence**: Utilizes browser `LocalStorage` to save and retrieve book data, ensuring the data remains even after the page is refreshed.
3. **Modular Code**: Separates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maintainability and readability.
4. **Dynamic Functionality**: Users can dynamically add and delete books without page reloads.
5. **Lightweight Application**: As a web-based project, no installation is required

### **Disadvantages:**

1. **No Authentication**: The application lacks user login or authentication, so data is shared across all users of the same browser.
2. **Limited Storage**: LocalStorage has a limit of 5MB, which may restrict the number of books that can be stored.
3. **No Cloud Backup**: If a user clears browser data, all books are lost.
4. **Single User Support**: No support for multiple users or profiles.
5. **Static Deployment**: The project does not use a backend or database, limiting scalability.
